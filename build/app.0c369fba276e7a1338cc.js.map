É necessário escolher a melhor forma de modulação em que a conexão se encaixa, utilizando como parâmetro a distância entre nodos. Assim, é possível calcular a quantidade de sub-portadoras necessárias para estabelecer a conexão utilizando a modulação atribuída. O RSA em conjunto com o problema da modulação é chamado de O problema do Roteamento, Atribuição de espectro e Modulação (RMLSA - Routing, Modulation and Spectrum Assignment).\"\r\n                ]} />\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        </Fade>\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n","\r\nimport { ApplicationStyles } from 'app/Theme';\r\nexport default {\r\n    ...ApplicationStyles,\r\n};\r\n","import { inline } from 'app/utils/StylesUtils';\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\nimport { FunctionComponent, useEffect } from 'react';\r\nimport styles from './EgAboutSpectrumStepStyles';\r\nimport { SpectrumText } from 'app/Components/SpectrumText/SpectrumText';\r\nimport { Fade } from '@material-ui/core';\r\nimport Typist from 'react-typist';\r\nimport { RainbowDiv } from 'app/Components/RainbowDiv/RainbowDiv';\r\nimport { SpectrumParagraphs } from 'app/Components/SpectrumParagraphs/SpectrumParagraphs';\r\nimport { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome';\r\nimport { Colors } from 'app/Theme';\r\nimport { faPlay, faFolder } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';\r\nimport { RainbowBorderButton } from 'app/Components/RainbowBorderButton/RainbowBorderButton';\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\ninterface IProps {\r\n    // Props type definition\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface IState {\r\n    // State type definition\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const EgAboutSpectrumStep: FunctionComponent<IProps> = (props) => {\r\n    const initialState: IState = {\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\n    // ComponentDidMount\r\n    useEffect(() => {\r\n        return () => {\r\n            //ComponentDidUnmount\r\n        }\r\n    }, [])\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <Fade timeout={1000} in={true}>\r\n            <div style={inline([styles.flexStretch, styles.fullWidthContainer, styles.centeredColumn, styles.zIndex3])}>\r\n                <SpectrumText weight={'bold'} style={inline([styles.headerText, styles.fullWidthContainer])}>\r\n                    <Typist cursor={{\r\n                        show: false,\r\n                        hideWhenDoneDelay: 300\r\n                    }} avgTypingDelay={30}>\r\n\r\n                        Sobre o Spectrum\r\n                        </Typist>\r\n                </SpectrumText>\r\n                <RainbowDiv style={styles.rainbowDivider} />\r\n                <SpectrumParagraphs paragraphs={[\r\n                    \"O Spectrum é um simulador de Redes Ópticas Elásticas (EON) cujo objetivo é promover simulações de forma abstraída, com configurações práticas e visuais.
